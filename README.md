Skin diseases affect a large portion of the population and require early and accurate diagnosis to prevent 
complications and ensure effective treatment. However, access to dermatologists is limited in many 
regions, leading to delays in medical consultation. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence and 
deep learning have enabled automated analysis of medical images, offering new possibilities for early 
disease detection. 
This project proposes an AI-Based Skin Disease Detection System that uses image processing and deep 
learning techniques to identify common skin diseases from digital images. The system allows users to 
upload skin images through a web or mobile interface. The uploaded images are preprocessed to enhance 
quality, and important visual features are extracted using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The 
trained model classifies the image into a specific skin disease category and provides the prediction along 
with a confidence score. 
The proposed system serves as a fast, cost-effective, and non-invasive tool for preliminary skin disease 
screening. It assists patients in understanding potential skin conditions and supports healthcare 
professionals by providing decision support. This solution can be effectively used in telemedicine 
applications and rural healthcare environments to improve early diagnosis and awareness.
